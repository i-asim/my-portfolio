## 🚀 Introduction

Next.js is a **React framework** that makes building modern, fast, and SEO-friendly web applications much easier.  
It adds powerful features on top of React, so developers can focus on creating experiences instead of handling complex setup.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **File-based routing** → Pages are created automatically from your project’s folder structure.  
- **Rendering options** → Supports **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**.  
- **API routes** → Build backend endpoints directly inside your Next.js project.  
- **Performance optimizations** → Image optimization, code splitting, and automatic bundling.  
- **Developer experience** → Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and simplified configuration.

## 🛠 Example

A simple Next.js page looks like this:

```tsx
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Next.js app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
